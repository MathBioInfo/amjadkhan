			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> My research interests lie in the mathematical modeling of biological and health-related problems with
an emphasis on bacterial pathogen evolution and infectious diseases. The development of modern technolo-
gies has resulted in a huge amount of data about various biological phenomena. The maximum utilization
of this available data in mathematical modeling of these problems will result in more informed models and
help in extracting more information. These data invite the mathematical modeler to use complementary
approaches between mathematical modeling and bioinformatics to answer different questions of interest.
In my Ph.D. research, in addition to predictive modeling, the emphasis was on the use of available data
to build more accurate and informed models. To further enhance these skills, in my postdoctoral study
under the supervision of Robert Beiko (Dalhousie University), I am learning about different bioinformatics
tools to generate new data and extract information from the available data to develop more informed
mathematical models.
