                                In this investigation, we examined the interaction of phages and bacteria in bacterial biofilm colonies, 
				the evolution of prophages (viral genetic material inserted into the bacterial genome) and their genetic
				repertoire. To study the synergistic effects of lytic phages and antibiotics on bacterial biofilm colonies, 
				we have developed a mathematical model of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We have also presented a 
				mathematical model consisting of a partial differential equation (PDEs), to study evolutionary forces acting 
				on prophages. We fitted the PDE model to three publicly available databases and were able to show that induction 
				is the prominent fate of intact prophages, with an average prophage loss of only 1% of its genome before induction. 
				We also demonstrate that there is a tipping point at which the relation between prophage and bacteria transforms 
				from being parasitic to mutualistic. Lastly, we investigated annotated prophages from two well-studied prophage 
				databases. These genes were accessed using PHASTER, a bioinformatics tool to identify prophages in bacterial genomes. 
				From this analysis, we observed that genes involved in phage lytic function are preferentially lost, while integrase 
				and transposase are preferentially enriched in smaller prophages. We have also developed an ODE model and have carried 
				out gene-level simulations to get more insight into the genetic repertoire of prophages. The results of our ODE model 
				and gene-level simulations are in agreement with prophage repertoire data.<p>

                                This investigation is devoted to the study of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) lattice dynamics. Approximations of the FPU lattice 
				dynamics have been an old subject, it is believed that the stability of the FPU traveling waves depends on the stability of 
				the KDV solitary waves. The key question is: Are the traveling waves of the FPU lattice stable if the traveling waves of KDV 
				type equation are stable?. We consider the FPU lattice with the nonlinear potential which leads to the generalized Korteweg-de 
				Vries (gKDV) equation, which is known to have orbitally stable traveling waves in a subcritical case and orbitally unstable 
				traveling waves in critical and supercritical cases. In order to pursue the question asked above, we use the energy method. We 
				establish that the H^s(R) norm of the solution of the gKDV equation is bounded by a time-independent constant in the subcritical 
				case, whereas the H^s(R) norm grows at most exponentially in the critical and supercritical cases. With the help of these results, 
				we extend the time scale for the approximation of the traveling waves of the FPU lattice by the traveling waves of the gKDV equation 
				logarithmically in the subcritical case. In the critical and supercritical cases, we extend the time scale by a double-logarithmic 
				factor. Our results show that the traveling waves of the FPU lattice are stable if the solitary waves of the gKDV equation are stable 
				in the subcritical case. On the other hand, in the critical and supercritical cases, our results are restricted to small-norm initial 
				data, which exclude solitary waves.<p>
